    "## 1. Introduction to Voronoi Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "A Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on the distance to a specified set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators). For each seed, there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of points $P = \\{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\\}$ in a plane, the Voronoi diagram divides the plane into $n$ regions, where each region $V(p_i)$ contains all points that are closer to $p_i$ than to any other point in $P$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(p_i) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : d(x, p_i) < d(x, p_j) \\text{ for all } j \\neq i\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d(x, y)$ is the distance between points $x$ and $y$, typically the Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Voronoi Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each Voronoi region is a convex polygon (or unbounded polyhedron).\n",
    "2. The edges of Voronoi regions are equidistant from the two nearest seed points.\n",

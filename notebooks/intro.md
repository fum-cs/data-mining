## Further Machine Learning Resources

- [The Scikit-Learn website](http://scikit-learn.org): The Scikit-Learn website has an impressive breadth of documentation and examples covering some of the models discussed here, and much, much more. If you want a brief survey of the most important and often-used machine learning algorithms, this is a good place to start.

- *SciPy, PyCon, and PyData tutorial videos*: Scikit-Learn and other machine learning topics are perennial favorites in the tutorial tracks of many Python-focused conference series, in particular the PyCon, SciPy, and PyData conferences. Most of these conferences publish videos of their keynotes, talks, and tutorials for free online, and you should be able to find these easily via a suitable web search (for example, "PyCon 2022 videos").

- [*Introduction to Machine Learning with Python*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do), by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guido (O'Reilly). This book covers many of the machine learning fundamentals discussed in these chapters, but is particularly relevant for its coverage of more advanced features of Scikit-Learn, including additional estimators, model validation approaches, and pipelining.

- [*Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn*](https://www.packtpub.com/product/machine-learning-with-pytorch-and-scikit-learn/9781801819312), by Sebastian Raschka (Packt). Sebastian Raschka's most recent book starts with some of the fundamental topics covered in these chapters, but goes deeper and shows how those concepts apply to more sophisticated and computationally intensive deep learning and reinforcement learning models using the well-known [PyTorch library](https://pytorch.org/).

```{note}
These lectures were built using the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://jupyterbook.org/) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  They are
intended mainly as a demonstration of these tools.
Instructions for how to build them from source can be found in the Jupyter
Book documentation.

# Course Resources for Data Mining

- [Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/): This website contains the full text of the Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas; the content is available on GitHub in the form of Jupyter notebooks, which is the main source of this course materials.

- [Pattern Classification by Richard O. Duda, Peter E. Hart, David G. Stork](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471056693.html)

- [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/)

- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop](https://www.rasa-ai.com/pattern-recognition-and-machine-learning-bishop/)

- [FUM Drive for DM course](https://fumdrive.um.ac.ir/index.php/s/pkD6FsZ5nyJiHY7)

## Further Machine Learning Resources

- [The Scikit-Learn website](http://scikit-learn.org): The Scikit-Learn website has an impressive breadth of documentation and examples covering some of the models discussed here, and much, much more. If you want a brief survey of the most important and often-used machine learning algorithms, this is a good place to start.

- *SciPy, PyCon, and PyData tutorial videos*: Scikit-Learn and other machine learning topics are perennial favorites in the tutorial tracks of many Python-focused conference series, in particular the PyCon, SciPy, and PyData conferences. Most of these conferences publish videos of their keynotes, talks, and tutorials for free online, and you should be able to find these easily via a suitable web search (for example, "PyCon 2022 videos").

- [*Introduction to Machine Learning with Python*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do), by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guido (O'Reilly). This book covers many of the machine learning fundamentals discussed in these chapters, but is particularly relevant for its coverage of more advanced features of Scikit-Learn, including additional estimators, model validation approaches, and pipelining.

- [*Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn*](https://www.packtpub.com/product/machine-learning-with-pytorch-and-scikit-learn/9781801819312), by Sebastian Raschka (Packt). Sebastian Raschka's most recent book starts with some of the fundamental topics covered in these chapters, but goes deeper and shows how those concepts apply to more sophisticated and computationally intensive deep learning and reinforcement learning models using the well-known [PyTorch library](https://pytorch.org/).

I should mention that the original material was from [Jake VanderPlas's Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/). I used his notebooks and modified it to suit my own needs and preferences. I would like to thank him for his great work and generosity.
